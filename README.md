### Description
KoinK is a mobile app made with React Native designed to help kids by teaching them "what is money".

First, you need to create an account. After that you will be directed to our home page, where you have acces to your level, your coins and a TabBar that allows you to travel along the App:

- Minigames: Rocket Pig and Pigzz. The first one is similar to Flappy Bird, and the second one is a Quiz.
- Challenges: Here you have daily challenges to help you gain more coins.
- Main Game: not implemented yet
- Store: It's where you can buy new avatars as well as Boosters, that can help you gain more coins.
- Profile: Here you can see and edit all your profile information.
